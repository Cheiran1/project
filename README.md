## Project Description
  This project offers users a historical travel experience by providing tips and suggested itineraries tailored to various ancient and historical time periods and locations. Users can select a time period (such as Medieval Europe, Renaissance Italy, or Ancient Egypt) and a specific city or place (like Paris, Cairo, or Rome) relevant to that era. Once a location and period are chosen, the program displays helpful travel tips and a suggested itinerary for that historical context, giving users an immersive glimpse into how they might travel in these past worlds.
## The Problem(that doesn't exist)
  There is no travelling guide if you want to experience the ancient times
## The Solution(that nobody asked for)
  We have created a website that allows users to select a time period and a place which will then provide tips and suggestion on how to explore the place.
